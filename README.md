# Text Notes
### A Christion FOSS project

Text Notes is a free and open source project I am attempting to create which
is guided by Christian values of community. The project is free to use and
redistribute and will attempt to provide some different strategies to learn
as well as contribute and develop on a basic item that all aspiring programmers
need.

In addition to the regular source files, I am including the workspace and
project data files for the [SlickEdit IDE](https://www.slickedit.com/) one of
my personal favorites since I was very young. Reasonably priced and various
features to tinker with.

As for the project license, I have as of yet to choose one and would be open to
some suggestions. I tend to prefer the Berkley and MIT licenses as they are
derived from traditional technical institutions and as such, provide some level
of wisdom and incite into the world of software and technology discourse, but
the GNU license is always a classic detailed license agreement that seems to
have grown from a sort of software democracy.

Either way, this initial set of code I am publishing isn't anything special and
as of the intial commit only serves as a super basic template of some C# forms
code with a little window into what I'm planning at this point. I would also
like to take the opportunity to provide some leg work for the GitHub platform
and as such will try to use as many features as I can so that anyone interested
can get a good idea of what type of project management and SCM it has to offer
in case you're ever in the market.

As such, the requirements will be a living document at this point in the 'wiki'
section with a plan to set up a structured project management strategy using
the 'projects' feature.

As the project grows and draws interest, I would like to also like to use the
'issues' platform for bug tracking and issues management.

I hope you enjoy and find what is here useful. If you have any suggestions,
please feel free to contact me and help me build A Christion Free and Open
Source Software project that can teach and provide useful functaionality for
our communities.

## Some items to consider
* Creating a branch system with tutorial and technical learning steps for new
developers.
* Writing a wiki branch that includes a Mono/DotNet Forms tutorial for the
user interface.
* Survey friends and family and/or community organizations about reasonable
useful features in a custom notes editor.

The aim here is to be somewhat minimalist and targeted at simple notes, but to
provide a structure that is based on well known patterns and algorithms that
can be built upon for extend and personalized experiences.

I understand this is by no means unique, and any comments that are directed at
this I would simply try to help you by politly pointing you to one of the other
projects:

* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) has been a favorite of mine and is
tailored specifically for editing various source code files.
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) and 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) are some great options for Java.
* [Elicpse](https://www.eclipse.org/) is probably the single most full featured 
open source IDE on the web. This is what you are looking for if you want all those
advanced features. *As a side note: SlickEdit makes a premium Eclipse pugin worth
checking out.*
